    body: `Frequently Asked Questions

Is Betcheza free?
Yes — browsing matches, viewing tips and reading our analysis is completely free.

Are the AI predictions guaranteed?
No prediction is guaranteed. AI picks combine real data (form, odds, head-to-head) but variance is part of betting. Always stake responsibly.

How are tipsters ranked?
Tipsters are ranked by ROI, win rate and consistency on settled tips. The leaderboard updates daily.

Can I become a tipster?
Yes. Sign up, post your first 10 tips, and your profile will be considered for verification.

How do I withdraw earnings?
Once your earnings clear the minimum threshold, you can withdraw via the payment methods configured for your country in your account settings.`,

Stay in control
- Set a daily and monthly deposit limit you can afford to lose.
- Never chase losses. A losing run doesn't owe you a comeback.
- Take regular breaks — at least one full day off per week.
- Don't bet under emotional or financial stress.

Warning signs
- Spending more than you planned, more often than you planned.
- Borrowing money to bet.
- Hiding bets from family or friends.
- Feeling restless or irritable when not betting.
